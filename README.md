# Learning Rubrix

This is a short intro to rubrix, a library for annotating data - primarily for machine learning applications but really for any annotation need you might have.

All the examples use a small sample dataset with english-language job advertisements from Norway in the 2010s.

Install rubrix with `pip install rubrix`.
